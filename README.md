# LinearRegression-CubicInterpolation
A program that allows, based on a certain sample of data, to make predictions based on the values of the input parameter entered from the keyboard. The problem is solved by the method of linear regression. The scikit library is used for this.

Also I've implemented a cubic interpolation algorithm in file cubic_interpolation
